# Product URL Fix - Mock Data Warning System

## Problem Solved: "Sorry! We couldn't find that page"

### Issue Description
When clicking "Visa" (View) on search results, users were getting Amazon's "Sorry! We couldn't find that page" error because the mock API was generating fake product URLs that don't exist on Amazon's website.

### Root Cause
- Mock API was creating fake ASINs like `B${Date.now()}123456789`
- These fake URLs don't correspond to real Amazon products
- AliExpress mock URLs were similarly non-functional

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Real Amazon Product Integration** ‚úÖ
Updated `/src/app/api/amazon/search/route.ts` to use real Amazon ASINs:

```typescript
const realProducts = [
  {
    asin: 'B08N5WRWNW', // Real Echo Dot ASIN
    title: 'Echo Dot (4th Gen, 2020 release)',
    category: 'Electronics',
    brand: 'Amazon',
    basePrice: 49.99
  },
  // ... more real products
];
```

**Benefits:**
- Real URLs lead to actual Amazon product pages
- Users can see real products when testing
- Maintains affiliate tracking functionality

#### 2. **Mock Product Detection System** ‚úÖ
Added intelligent detection for demo/mock products:

```javascript
function viewAPIProductSafe(url) {
  // Check if this is a mock/demo product
  if (url.includes('mock') || url.includes('demo') || url.includes('Demo Product')) {
    showNotification('‚ö†Ô∏è Detta √§r en demo-produkt f√∂r utveckling...', 'error');
    return;
  }
  // ... proceed with real URL
}
```

#### 3. **Visual Mock Product Indicators** ‚úÖ
Enhanced product cards with clear demo indicators:

- **Orange border** for mock products
- **"DEMO" badge** in top-right corner  
- **Warning text** below product info
- **Different button text** ("üìã Demo Info" vs "üëÅÔ∏è Visa")

#### 4. **Improved AliExpress Mock Data** ‚úÖ
Updated AliExpress API with more realistic product patterns:

```typescript
const sampleProducts = [
  { id: '1005001234567890', title: 'Wireless Bluetooth Earphones' },
  { id: '1005002345678901', title: 'LED String Lights' },
  // ... realistic AliExpress product IDs
];
```

### User Experience Improvements

#### Before Fix:
- ‚ùå Clicking "Visa" ‚Üí Amazon 404 error
- ‚ùå No way to distinguish mock from real products
- ‚ùå Confusing user experience

#### After Fix:
- ‚úÖ Real Amazon products ‚Üí actual product pages
- ‚úÖ Mock products ‚Üí clear warning with explanation
- ‚úÖ Visual indicators for demo content
- ‚úÖ Professional development experience

### Files Modified

1. **`/src/app/api/amazon/search/route.ts`**
   - Real Amazon ASIN integration

- Clearly marked demo products (with warnings)
- Perfect for testing and development

#### Production Ready:

- All products will be real and clickable
- Demo indicators automatically disappear

### Testing Instructions

1. **Search for products** in admin panel
2. **Look for visual indicators:**

### Future Improvements

1. **Real API Integration**: Connect to actual Amazon Product Advertising API
2. **Product Validation**: Verify URLs before displaying
3. **Caching**: Cache real product data to reduce API calls
4. **Error Handling**: Better fallbacks for API failures

This fix ensures a professional user experience while maintaining the development-friendly mock data system!
